# Ray Tracer Challenge

A ray tracer written in Python based on the book "[The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/)" by Jamis Buck.

# About

This is my attempt to learn Python by implementing the test specifications for a ray tracer in the book. The BDD tests have been implemented using [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave). These are really my first steps in Python. So please be kind...
